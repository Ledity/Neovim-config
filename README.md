# Ledity's Neovim Config

This project's goal is to build a Neovim configuration that makes it a convenient, beatiful and convenient code editor with IDE capabilities.
The configuration itself is separated into two blocks: one is for helper functions definitions, plugins installation and other inner stuff. The second one is for user's preferences, such as keybindings, vim options, etc.
